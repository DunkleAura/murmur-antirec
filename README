Features of antirec.py:
  * Members of the group defined in "canallowrecording" can allow other users
    to record (membership must be defined in the root channel).
  * An admin can't grant himself permission to record. Only another admin can do that.
  * If a user gets the permission to record a short notice will be send to the channel.
  * If the permission to record is revoked the user is being deafend instantly if he is still recording.
  * The permission is bound to the session ID; if the users disconnects the permission is gone.

The advantage of an own group to give recording permission to other users is that
 you don't need to permit admin access to the whole server :)

If you don't need these features, please use the antirec_legacy.py; users just get deafend when starting to record.

Change...:
  canallowrecording="canallowrecording"
  to the group name you want to allow to give recording permission to other users.
