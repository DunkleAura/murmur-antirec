Features of antirec.py:
  * Members of the groups defined in "canallowrecording" can allow other users
    to record (membership must be defined in the root channel).
  * An admin can't grant himself permission to record. Only another admin can do that (can be changed in settings).
  * If a user gets the permission to record a short notice will be send to the channel.
  * If the permission to record is revoked the user is being deafend instantly if he is still recording.
  * The permission is bound to the session ID; if the users disconnects the permission is gone.
  * Punishment can be KICK or DEAF :)
  * User can receive a list of users they can permit recording on connect (if JOININFO = True)
  * User can receive a list of who's currently recording on connect (if JOININFO = True)

The advantage of an own group to give recording permission to other users is that
 you don't need to permit admin access to the whole server :)

If you don't need these features, please use the antirec_legacy.py; users just get deafend when starting to record.

Settings:
    # Name of the groups that are allowed to give others permission to record :)

    PUNISHMENT = "DEAF"     # Punishment for users that try to record :P" Can be "DEAF" or "KICK".
    ADMINALLOWSELF = False  # Don't allow members of the group canallowrecording to permit themselfs to record. (True or False)

    JOININFO = False  # Shows a small piece of Information on Join
